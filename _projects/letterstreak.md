              ### **Overview**


              LetterStreak brings the excitement of daily word games, inspired
              by the popular Wordle, where players engage in a captivating race
              to complete words by filling in missing letters and compete for
              the top spot. With a robust points and ranking system, players can
              climb leaderboards and challenge friends for ultimate word
              mastery.


              From crafting the name, logo, and design to sculpting the user
              interface and experience, I meticulously curated a simple,
              intuitive, and modern platform where players eagerly return each
              day for their dose of wordplay fun.


              Powered by Next.js and hosted on Vercel, LetterStreak generates
              new word challenges daily, ensuring every player faces the same
              thrilling puzzles. Crafting an algorithm to generate these words
              challenged me to optimize performance, delivering a seamless
              gaming experience for all players.
