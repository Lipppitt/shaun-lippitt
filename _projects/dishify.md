              ### **Overview**


              Dishify simplifies recipe discovery, enabling users to search by
              ingredients or cuisine type via our intuitive interface.
              Seamlessly responsive, Dishify ensures a seamless user experience
              across all devices.


              Powered by Laravel, Inertia.js, Vue.js, and integrated with the
              Spoonacular API, Dishify streamlines the recipe-finding process.
              From conceptualising the name and logo to crafting the UI and UX,
              I led the development of Dishify's identity and functionality.
