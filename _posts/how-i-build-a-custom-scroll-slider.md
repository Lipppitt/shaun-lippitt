              ## Why the Custom Scroll Slider?


              While numerous carousel plugins exist, many lack the functionality
              to navigate using mouse scroll and swiping, elements that
              significantly enhance user experience. Existing options often
              proved glitchy, failing to accurately calculate scroll positions
              after manual navigation. This led me to create my own!

              ## The magic


              ## The final result
