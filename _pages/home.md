      **Hello, I’m Shaun.** I'm a self-taught, full stack developer with over 10 years experience in building websites. Unlike most web developers, I have good eye for design which allows me to take a different perspective on a project. I believe websites should be fast, easy-to-use and accessible.

      Some of the technologies I work with are: PHP, Laravel, Wordpress, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, jQuery, Vue.js, Node.js & React.
